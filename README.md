  <h2>About Nyssa</h2>
  <p>Nyssa is puppy number 9. She arrived quickly with eyes closed and already skeptical. While her siblings barreled through life like tiny tanks, she took her time – sniffing, pausing, and thinking. New things? Suspicious. Sudden movements? Absolutely not. But offer her a warm lap and gentle voice, and she'll melt like butter in the sun. Affectionate and clingy in the sweetest way, she's the first to nuzzle under your chin and the last to let go. Born ninth, cautious by nature, whisper-soft – she’s the undercover sweetheart of the litter.</p>
